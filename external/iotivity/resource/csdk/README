  NOTICE - Transition to SCONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The IoTivity build system is transitioning to SCONS. Although the 
makefiles are still available (until v1.0) and some developers are 
still using them, they are currently no longer supported. To learn more 
about building using SCONS see Readme.scons.txt in the repository root 
directory. The build steps used in continuous integration can be found
in auto_build.sh which is also in the the repository root directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Linux**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To make octbstack.a in release mode:

	make

To make octbstack.a in debug mode:

	make BUILD=debug

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Arduino**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Touch (i.e. create) file named "local.properties" at this directory level with
the following definition(s):

	ARDUINO_DIR = <PATH_TO_ARDUINO_INSTALL_DIR>/arduino-1.0.5
    ARDUINO_TOOLS_DIR = <PATH_TO_ARDUINO_TOOLS> (location of avr-g++ and other avr tools)

To make octbstack.a in release mode:
	make PLATFORM=arduinomega (For Arduino Due, use <arduinodue>)

To make octbstack.a in debug mode:
	make PLATFORM=arduinomega BUILD=debug (For Arduino Due, use <arduinodue>)

To make octbstack.a with Arduino WiFi Shield support:
	make PLATFORM=arduinomega ARDUINOWIFI=1 (For Arduino Due, use <arduinodue>)

Dependencies:
    1) Patch the Wiznet Ethernet library with the patch available at :
    oic-utilities/tb/arduino_linux_ethernet_socket_cpp.patch
    2) Arduino builds are dependent on latest Time library. Download it from here:
    http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Time.html
    3) Arduino Due has been tested with Arduino 1.5.7 framework.
    4) For Arduino Due, binary tools are located in:
       /hardware/tools/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4.8.3-2014q1/bin
    5) For Arduino WiFi, update the WiFi shield with the firmware patches provided
       by Intel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Clean-Up**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To clean only stack modules:

	make clean

To clean stack modules and libcoap (i.e. networking) modules & its
dependencies:

	make deepclean
